# Modern Survey Form

This project is a complete overhaul of a survey form I originally built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification three years ago. The goal was to take an old project and bring it up to modern standards, showcasing my UI/UX and frontend development skills.

## Original Project

The original project was a simple, single-page survey form built with basic HTML and Bootstrap. You can find the original project in the `legacy` branch of this repository.

## The Overhaul

I completely redesigned and re-engineered the survey form to create a modern, user-friendly experience. Here are some of the key improvements:

### UI/UX Overhaul

*   **Modern Design:** The form has a clean, modern design with a new color scheme, typography, and layout.
*   **Multi-Step Form:** The single-page form has been converted into a multi-step form to improve user experience, especially for longer surveys.
*   **Progress Bar:** A progress bar shows users how far they've progressed in the survey.
*   **Animations and Transitions:** Subtle animations and transitions make the form more dynamic and engaging.

### New Features

*   **Client-Side Validation:** The form has robust client-side validation to provide immediate feedback to users and prevent the submission of incomplete or invalid data.
*   **Accessibility Improvements:** The form's accessibility has been enhanced by adding ARIA attributes and ensuring proper keyboard navigation.
*   **Engaging Questions:** The survey now includes more engaging and interesting questions related to gaming.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
